# LED-game

LED Game description:

The LED game is a reaction time game that turns a random lead in the circuit playground and the player uses either the left or right button to press for a reaction time of less than 50 to greater than 100 milliseconds. The led turns green when the player has a fast enough reaction time, and the led turns blue when the player has a moderate reaction time, and the led turns red for slow reaction times. Once either of the buttons are pressed the pixels are cleared and the game repeats. 

Objective: Press either button as fast as possible to turn the led green as soon as the red led lights up. The time constraint for reaction is between 50 and 100 milliseconds. If the led is red, your reaction time was greater than 100 milliseconds. A sound will play when the reaction time is slow. 

Inputs: Left and Right buttons

Outputs: LED and sound
